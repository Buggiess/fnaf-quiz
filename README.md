## Description

This is a quiz based on the video game Five Night's at Freddy's. I have used vanilla Javascript to traverse through the quiz and save and display the scores using local storage.

I would like to thank my good friend Yassin who helped me figure out a lot of the issues and nitpickings of this. Especially with the score sorting and local storage issues.
